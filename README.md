# 🫀 Coronary Artery Stenosis Analysis: Integrated Segmentation and Grading

### 🚀 Project Overview

This repository hosts the code for an **advanced deep learning model** designed for the **automated analysis of Coronary Artery Stenosis (CAS)** from **X-ray Angiography** images.  

The system performs two crucial tasks simultaneously:

1. **🩻 Vessel Segmentation:**  
   Accurately identifies and segments coronary arteries using a **Transformer-based U-Net** architecture.

2. **📊 Stenosis Grading:**  
   Classifies the severity of coronary artery blockage using a **Bottleneck Classifier** trained on deep feature representations from the segmentation encoder.

## 🎯 Architecture Details

The core of this solution is a **two-module system** leveraging **transfer learning**.

| Module | Model Architecture | Purpose |
|--------|--------------------|----------|
| **Encoder Backbone** | MiT-B5 (Mix Transformer B5) | Extracts rich, multi-scale features, capturing long-range dependencies in vascular structures. |
| **Segmentation Head** | U-Net Decoder | Reconstructs the segmentation mask from encoder features, predicting a binary mask (vessel/background). |
| **Grading Head** | Bottleneck Classifier | Maps the bottleneck features (final encoder output) to one of five stenosis severity classes. |

---

## 💡 Stenosis Grading Classes

The classification model predicts **one of 5 severity grades**, based on the degree of arterial narrowing:

| Class ID | Grade Label | Description (Percentage Stenosis) |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| 0 | p0_20 | Minimal (0–20%) |
| 1 | p20_50 | Mild/Moderate (20–50%) |
| 2 | p50_70 | Severe (50–70%) |
| 3 | p70_90 | Critical (70–90%) |
| 4 | p100 | Total Occlusion (100%) |

## ⚙️ Local Setup and Installation

### 🧩 Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### 🪜 Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]
cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]
🪜 Step 2: Install Dependencies
The required libraries are listed in requirements.txt.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
🪜 Step 3: Download Model Weights (MANDATORY)
The application requires two separate model weights.
The Python script automatically downloads them via gdown if not found locally,
but you can also download them manually:

Model	File Name	Google Drive Link
Segmentation Weights (MiT-B5 U-Net)	model_mit_b5_256_best_dice.pth	Download Here
Grading Classifier Weights (Bottleneck)	unet_bottleneck_classifier_new.pth	Download Here

⚠️ Place both files in the root directory for proper loading.

🪜 Step 4: Run the Application
bash
Copy code
python "app (21).py"
A local Gradio interface will launch.
Access it in your browser at the provided localhost URL, e.g.:

cpp
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:7860
